I learned how to root CSS variables, which i was able to customize for use for the project. it was awesome like the pattern and will use it going forward.


```css
:root {
  --very-dark-blue: hsl(233, 47%, 7%);
  --dark-desaturated-blue: hsl(244, 38%, 16%);
  --soft-violet: hsl(277, 64%, 61%);
  --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --slightly-transparent-white: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.75);
  --slightly-transparent-white: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.6);
  --inter-font: "Inter", sans-serif;
  --lexen-font: "Lexend Deca", sans-serif;
}

```

### Useful resources
