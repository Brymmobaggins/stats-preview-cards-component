### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned how to root CSS variables, which I was able to customize for the project. It was awesome and i liked the pattern, i  will use it going forward.


```css
:root {
  --very-dark-blue: hsl(233, 47%, 7%);
  --dark-desaturated-blue: hsl(244, 38%, 16%);
  --soft-violet: hsl(277, 64%, 61%);
  --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --slightly-transparent-white: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.75);
  --slightly-transparent-white: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.6);
  --inter-font: "Inter", sans-serif;
  --lexen-font: "Lexend Deca", sans-serif;
}

```

### Useful resources

- [Google font](https://wwww.Googlefont.com) - This helped me to get the exact font family and font-weight instructed in this project. I  liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
